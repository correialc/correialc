### About Me

- I'm a backend engineer with a strong background in database systems. 
- I love coding to express myself and translate my curiosity into something meaningful. 
- I'm working on a [maze generator and solver](https://github.com/correialc/mazy). Automating maze creation and resolution is a fascinating scenario to improve algorithms, data structures, and machine learning skills.
- I've been studying Machine Learning and having fun with Natural Language Processing (NLP). [Here](https://github.com/correialc/saan) is a simple text classifier I've created for Brazilian normative acts (codebase is in Portuguese due to the nature of the project). 

### I'm interessed in...

- Data manipulation projects (data integration, large datasets, performance optimization)
- Machine Learning projects (full-text queries, text classifiers, NLP)
