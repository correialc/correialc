### About Me

I'm a backend engineer with a strong background in database systems. I love coding as a way to express myself and translate my curiosity into something meaningful. 

### Working on...

[Mazy](https://github.com/correialc/mazy), a maze generator and solver. Automating maze creation and resolution is a facinating scenario to develop skills in algorithms, data structures and machine learning.
